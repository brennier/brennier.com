                This website contains various information regarding my many projects over the years, including research papers I've done, programs I've written, and prototype devices I've created. At the moment, I have just finished my bachelor's degree in Pure Mathematics from the University of Oklahoma and have started a PhD in Mathematics at the University of Virginia.

                You can find things like the research I've done and some of the problem sets I've completed under the "Mathematics" tab. Additionally, I have many other projects that might be of note, such as a vim plugin that I currently maintain for typing LaTeX quickly, a custom keyboard that I hand-wired and programmed, as well as a 8-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) that I built in Minecraft. You can find out more about these things under the "Projects" tab above.
