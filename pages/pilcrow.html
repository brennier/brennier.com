            This keyboard is a Pilcrow layout keyboard. This means that the keys are all uniform and square ("1u" keys), and that they're arranged in a 4x10 grid. This layout is not very popular, and I only know of two other people who have built one (monkeyplusplus and Gnmar2723). I think it turned out really well considering I've never even soldered before. Here is a picture of the software layout:

            This is how I've managed to fit everything on 40 keys. It's working pretty well at the moment, but I may choose to modify it a bit over time. In fact, I've already switched "Bksp" and "Enter" around, which is much more natural.

            Here are some additional pictures of the building process:
