            <p class="post-body">
            A lot has happened in two months. The most important is that I was accepted into a program funded by the NSF! I'll be going to Uzbekistan to study Leibniz Algebras with a Dr. Ayupov. I'm not really sure what to expect, as I've never been to a country like Uzbekistan, but I'm hoping that it'll be a great experience.
            <br><br>
            In other news, I've updated QuickTex significantly: I've added the documentation and "published" it (i.e. posted about it on Reddit). I've got quite a few github stars on the repository now, which is really nice to see. Lastly, finals are over, and while I haven't recieved all of my grades back, I did at least get A's in my two graduate courses! In any case, I leave for Uzbekistan on May 31st, so wish me luck!

            <p class="post-body">
            I've been a little busy lately. I've recently had quite a few mid-terms, and I've tried applying to REUs during the summer. Unfortunately, it seems that it's actually very difficult to get into an REU in pure mathematics. A lot of REUs have switched to a unified application system. This combined with the facts that REUs have been shutting down and that REU applications have no cost, it seems that the whole system is a little flooded. Unfortunately, there seem to be two types of REUs: the ones that try to get students more exposed to what a math degree would be like, and the ones that are very serious and want the very best students. I have the unfortunate happenstance to be caught inbetween these two groups--not good enough to get into the REUs that want the best of the best, but too experienced to be recuited by the REUs that focus on exposing mathematics to those who are unsure. Perhaps this theory is completely wrong though. I've had a few people back it up, but who knows.
            <br><br>
            In any case, I have a few other updates:
            <br><br>
            1) The Pilcrow Keyboard has had a few minor improvements. I've redesigned and ordered the acrylic layers, and I've been able to make it about 30% thinner. It now looks much better, in my opinion. Also, I bought a custom mini-USB cord for it and I added little rubber squares so that it doesn't slide on my glass desk.
            <br><br>
            2) I've made a lot of improvements to Vimtexer. Perhaps the most obvious one is changing the name from Vimtexer to QuickTex, as Vimtexer was way too close to the popular vim plugin called vimtex. Also notable is support for $ sign delimiters, which was a little difficult to implement. Additionally, some major speed improvements were introduced (perhaps not noticable to some, as it ran so fast anyway, but it might be more noticable to those with a lot of other plugins installed). I'm planning on writing a documentation file pretty soon, and after that, I'll start trying to get the word out a bit more publicly.
            <br><br>
            3) I've started using Anki to help with the memorization of pretty much everything. At the moment, it's mostly for language-learning, which has been very successful, but I plan on eventually expanding it to memorizing other things like mathematical definitions and counterexamples. Anki has proved to be a lot more effective than I was predicting; my French has arguably been improving even faster than when I was living in France!

            I'm finally done with my Pilcrow layout keyboard! A Pilcrow keyboard basically means that the keys are all uniform and square ("1u" keys), and that they're arranged in a 4x10 grid. This layout is not very popular, and I only know of two other people who have built one (monkeyplusplus and Gnmar2723). I think it turned out really well considering I've never even soldered before. Here is a picture of the software layout:

            This is how I've managed to fit everything on 40 keys. It's working pretty well at the moment, but I may choose to modify it a bit over time. In fact, I've already switched "Bksp" and "Enter" around, which is much more natural. As a bonus, here are some additional pictures of the building process:

            <p class="post-body">
            I've been quite busy lately, it seems. Unfortunately, I've decided to postpone doing those Princeton problems for the moment. I started the graduate Algebra one, but I quickly found that most of the questions are on topics that appear in the second semester of graduate Algebra. I figure that it'll probably be best to do them after this semester then. I'm currently building my custom keyboard, which should be finished within the week. So far, though, it's been coming to together quite nicely. I'll be sure to post pictures when I'm done. I've also upgraded my computer, finally going from 4GB to 8GB of RAM. Additionally, I've installed a Samsung Pro SSD, which has been a serious speed improvement. And lastly, I've been trying out Soylent, the supposed food substitue of the future. While it's definitely weird to drink your entire meal, I find Soylent to be extremely useful on-the-go in order to stop me from eating out or on campus. All in all, things have really picked up now that the semester has started, so I'll probably be posting less often again, but I'll be sure to post pictures of my new keyboard when I've finished it!

            <p class="post-body">
            Well, it's a new year! I've mostly been doing holiday celebrations and visiting my parents. Unfortunately, I've been quite ill for the past 5 days, which has left very little time for me to accomplish anything. On the plus side, I designed a custom keyboard around two weeks ago. I should have all the parts necessary for building on the 12th. I actually have everything except for the custom acrylic cutouts that I've ordered. However, since I'm using acrylic for the top plate, I really can't do anything until that arrives. I apologize if that last sentence made no sense to you. I promise that once I do get all the parts, I'll be posting quite a few pictures and maybe even a build description/guide. All in all, it's been a very revelatory experience. There are a lot of little things that one needs to make sure are perfectly lined up when it comes to designing a physical product, things like: screw holes, precise dimensions, adding internal support, choosing the type of switches, programming your custom layout, buying the right diodes, etc. Anyway, I'll finally be able to start working on those Princeton Problems now that I'm no longer sick, so watch out for an update in around two weeks where I'll talk about those problems and also my keyboard build progress!

            <p class="post-body">
            As you can tell from the title, I've decided to mark my latest commit of Vimtexer as 1.0. There are a few more additions that I have planned, such as support for other kinds of "mathmodes" and additional compatibility with a few popular LaTeX packages (e.g. tikz-cd), but overall, the feeling of Vimtexer seems to be fairly complete. Also, I've finally gotten rid of all the bugs that I've found so far. Now it's time to actually use the program! The Fall Semester is finally over as of a few days ago, and now that I no longer have class to attend, I'll be working through a set of math problems that Princeton posted in 2013. The problems were posted by Princeton to help math graduate students get a feel for what to expect on the Princeton qualifying exams. I figured that they seemed to be at the perfect "slightly out of reach" level for me, so I hope that I learn a lot! Anyway, I'll be posting the solutions to those problem sets as I complete them. Hopefully I'll be able to get quite a few of the problems done before the winter break ends. In addition to this, I'll also be applying to various math REUs over the break. I figured that I should probably start on obtaining some actual research experience before I apply to graduate school a year from now. In any case, I hope I get accepted at a good one, so wish me luck!

            <p class="post-body">
            It's been about a month since my last post, and it seems that I was wrong about Vimtexer no longer needing updates. I found a few bugs that were a little annoying and also I just thought that it could be better. I made it a little more customizable, removed text objects (they just seemed tacked-on, in all honesty), added support for other types of files besides .tex, separated the dictionaries from the actual program, turned off suggested dictionaries by default, and refactored the code in an attempt to remove some bugs that I was finding. Incidentally, not once does the plugin use normal mode now, and I think that this has made the code significantly faster as well. Also, I have some plans in mind on how I can improve the plugin even further. It's a little strange how much you can continually improve just about 100 lines of code. In any case, I doubt I'm going to try to create my own LaTeX-esque language in the near future, even just trying to come up with a formal grammar is difficult. Also, I should be posting more actively over this next month as my school semester ends in two weeks. Until then, though, I should get back to studying for my finals in my graduate classes (Real Analysis and Abstract Algebra).

            <p class="post-body">
            I know that I haven't posted any updates here for while, but I just wanted to announce that my vim plugin for LaTeX, vimtexer, is now, at least in my eyes, stable. After a fair bit of coding and adding some new features here and there, I'm pretty happy with the way that it has turned out, and I don't have any more ideas that I can think of to implement. For the future, I'm considering the possibility of creating a new language for typing/formatting mathematics that'll compile into LaTeX. Why go to this extreme? If I have learned anything from the process of developing vimtexer, its that LaTeX could be typed in a much, much faster manner. Creating a new language from scratch will allow people who use any text editor to type in a more efficient way to create beautiful mathematics. Not only that, but I have a few features that I would like to add, such as the ability to set local aliases, to have a separate namespace for "mathematics" and for "regular typing", and to more easily set custom commands that are more powerful and customizable. In any case, I hope that for the moment, people are as satisfied as I am with the speed improvements that vimtexer brings.

            <p class="post-body">
            I have recently released the first version of my vimtexer program. As you may imagine, it's a vim plugin that allows to type in LaTeX significantly faster. Specifically, it allows the user to map keywords typed in insert mode into arbitrary keypresses, including the calling of functions or just simply mapping into a different string. Perhaps most importantly, the namespace for these keywords are different for each type of file and also is different depending if one is in mathmode or just typing normal LaTeX. Since variables are always a single character, one can use an abundance of keywords while in math mode. This has helped speed up my LaTeX typing extremely. It's still a little specific to my personal preferences at the moment, but I hope to generalize it soon enough. I hope it helps someone out there! I'll be sure to post updates as I use it more!
